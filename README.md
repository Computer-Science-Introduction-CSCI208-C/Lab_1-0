# Introduction to Programming II (C++) 
# Lab 1 

**This lab is a refresher of concepts you will use repeatedly, including file I/O.

## Minimum Viable Product

- [ ] In this project, the goal is to take data from a text file and store the values into an array(s). 
- [ ] Next, you should output the array to another data file. 
- [ ] The program should then go back to the beginning of the input file and read the information again. This time, instead of storing the data in an array, the information should output directly to the file. 

## Note

Consider using functions from the `fstream` library:  
`clear( )` and `seekg ( )`
